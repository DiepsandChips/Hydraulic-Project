# Hydraulic-Project

Fluid power is just another word for describing hydraulics and pneumatics technologies. Both of these technologies use liquid or gas to transmit power from one location to another. For hydraulics, the fluid is mostly oil, therefore pneumatics uses compressed air. 

The technology of fluid power is used in many industries in todayâ€™s world like automotive assembly lines, passenger airlines, packaging equipment, cranes, forklifts, and many more. Fluid power can be used for many tough tasks like creating a tunnel or even lifting or stacking containers. Within the fluid power system, it can push, lift, pull, grip, or rotate almost any load. 

Fluid power systems contain four important components which are valve, actuator, pump, and reservoir tank. However, there are some components that are extremely necessary but cylinders, hoses, fittings, gauges, sensors, filters, or seals could be used to refine the system for either accurate operation or to increase the lifespan of the system or the parts themselves.
